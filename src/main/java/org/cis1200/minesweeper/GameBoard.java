/**
 * This class instantiates a TicTacToe object, which is the model for the game.
 * As the user clicks the game board, the model is updated. Whenever the model
 * is updated, the game board repaints itself and updates its status JLabel to
 * reflect the current state of the model.
 * 
 * This game adheres to a Model-View-Controller design framework. This
 * framework is very effective for turn-based games. We STRONGLY
 * recommend you review these lecture slides, starting at slide 8,
 * for more details on Model-View-Controller:
 * https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis120/current/files/slides/lec37.pdf
 * 
 * In a Model-View-Controller framework, GameBoard stores the model as a field
 * and acts as both the controller (with a MouseListener) and the view (with
 * its paintComponent method and the status JLabel).
